1.When should accessor methods be used?
Returning Objects Through Interfaces: When a method returns an object that implements a specific interface.
*Reason:
-Interface Isolation: The interface defines the behavior the code interacts with, not the internal data structure of the returned object.
-Encapsulation Protection: Even if the internal implementation of the object changes, as long as the interface behavior remains consistent, the code using the object remains unaffected. This protects data integrity and encapsulation.

2.If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Java does not allow to build create a constructor method to build a DVD by category after craeting a constructor method to build a DVD by title
Because: "category" and "title" have the same variable type String so Java can not distinguish two variables when user inputs
